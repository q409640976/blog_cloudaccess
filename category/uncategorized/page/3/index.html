		<div>
<p>In my <a href="https://bruck.me/2019/05/02/chase-your-dreams/">previous post</a> I’ve mentioned my entry to programming was first via C++ and afterwards I wandered of into the wide fields of web development. A fundamental problem back then for me was that I did not have any money and that properly running a website required you to have a static IP with a Webserver that ideally could not only deliver static content like HTML, CSS and images, but also included PHP to have dynamic content.</p>
<p>One of those hosters, that offered free webspace was <a href="http://www.cybton.com/">cybton.com</a>. As it did not have any ads on the pages offered through the webspace itself and had a cool community with a bonus system, that was the one I’ve opted for. The bonus system allowed you to upgrade your webspace to get more disk space and  other cool features. You could earn points to “buy” those perks by actively engaging in the community. Imagine those fake internet points from stackoverflow would allow you to get a free server. </p>
<p>It was super successful and at its peek, the community was super active and newcomers were quickly helped with getting their project started. One thing I remember quite clearly back then was the mostly German based folks were very understanding for people with no coding background. Things got explained multiple times and in detail until the original poster understood. </p>
<p>Good community guidelines, moderation and patience of the members lead to a very welcoming atmosphere. One I was <em>proud</em> to be part of. When I compare it to other forums that I was active on in the good old days, there was none of the aggressiveness of “<a href="http://www.giyf.com/">GIYF</a>” as an answer to every question. There were some repetitive questions, but those were usually quickly helped by linking the solution instead of telling others that they are not using search correctly. </p>
<p>I think this is something todays platforms for coding advice often get wrong. Yes, repetition is bad for having well organized  structured information or being an encyclopedia, but for humans repetition is a necessity. We do it literately from when we first go to school: we learn with the teacher first and repeat using homework and exercises. Our brain learns by realizing that one solution works, after seeing it several times. </p>
<p>Stackoverflow has become so good at delivering just the right answer for almost any question that the learning effect goes down to zero. Most answers contain exactly that one snippet of code you are looking for and every time you need it, you try to search for that one question with the answer. Because lets be honest, how many of you actually read the whole posts <strong>before</strong> trying out the code snippet?</p>
<p>Coming back to cybton.com, I just recently had to think about it and wandered off to check it out. Just a few months/years back it was still running and I logged in for good old sake. Unfortunately the owners finally did decide that the old system was due to be turned off after 15 years of operation. That was the place I first learned about PHP, dynamic programming, OOP and lots more – ahhh, good old simple times.</p>

It is a very nice gesture to recognize all the moderators that spend years on that platform. I can recall many of the names that I communicated with on a daily basis. If any of you are still reading this, reach out <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"></p>
<p>Finally I want to thank <a href="http://alexander-windbichler.com/">Alex</a> and Benno. Both of them were excellent owners that were super supportive – even when things looked grim. They put in a lot of work for a system that was free and probably was not earning them too much money. I was lucky enough to work together with Alex at his company <a href="https://www.anexia-it.com/de/">anexia.at</a> for a few weeks as an intern a few years ago. Go check them out, they are amazing!</p>

</article><article id="post-29" class="post-29 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"><header class="entry-header"><div class="entry-meta"><span class="screen-reader-text">发布于</span><a href="https://liming.imfast.io/29.html" rel="bookmark"><time class="entry-date published updated" datetime="2020-04-29T19:12:27+08:00">2020-04-29</time></a></div><h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://liming.imfast.io/29.html" rel="bookmark">Operating your own mail server is a pain</a></h2>	</header><div class="entry-content">
		<div>
<p><strong>tl:dr;</strong> I’m going to tell you all the reasons you shouldn’t run your own mail server.</p>
<p>I actually wanted to name this post “Thinking about running your own mail server? Here is why this is a bad idea” but I’d like for everyone to opt out of click bait titles. I stopped clicking on anything that sounds like click bait (Youtube, Twitter, News) as my brain got trained to see those as low quality time stealers. </p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to talk about my experience of running a mail server. Over the last 10+ years I’ve operated my own mail server on VMs hosted by <a href="http://netcup.de/">netcup.de</a>. (Not a paid ad, I promise) Their servers have decent performance and for just a few euros they are a steal. </p>
<p>So I went and setup <a href="https://www.ispconfig.org/">ispconfig</a> – a management interface for basic web, mail and dns servers – to have a more simpler interface for configuration. Till Brehm (the maintainer of ispconfig) is doing an amazing job at developing that piece of software over the last decade. The interface is clean, neat and gives your customers basic settings to do self service if they want to.</p>
<h2>Configuring a mail server is complex</h2>
<p>Configuring your mail server is more than a couple configuration files. Its also very reliant on a clean and proper DNS configuration. You need to fulfill a few basic requirements for your emails to get delivered:</p>
<ul><li>A SMTP, IMAP and MTA systems</li>
<li>A proper stable DNS setup (ideally with DNSSEC)</li>
<li>SPF – a DNS record of what IPs/mail servers are allowed to send emails under your domain</li>
<li>DKIM – automatic signatures for all your sent emails, so other mail servers can verify the messages originated from a trusted source</li>
<li>DMARC – get reports of misuse of your mail services</li>
<li>Rate limiting – don’t let your users send too many emails</li>
<li>Monitoring – it happens from time to time that your mail server gets blacklisted</li>
</ul><p>So just installing ispconfig on your VM is certainly not going to get you all of the above. In fact all you get out of the box is the first point: a SMTP and IMAP server. The rest needs tedious manual config file adaption and looking through various other tools which can automate this work away.</p>
<h3>SMTP, IMAP and MTA</h3>
<p><strong>Quick intro to how email works:</strong> Your mail client connects to the SMTP server. SMTP is the protocol used to submit new emails for sending. The MTA then accepts those messages and forwards it to the receivers MTA. The receiving MTA checks its configuration to find the right IMAP account to store the email in. Your mail client connects to this IMAP account to view any stored emails.<br><em>(don’t quote me on the correctness of this)</em></p>
<p>Email is one of the oldest protocols on the internet. One of the earliest versions has been specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc561">RFC 561</a> in 1973. The software we have today is equally as old and brittle. Over the years developers have added bits and pieces to support newer features like virus scanning and server side filtering. But none of the available open source systems are the easiest to configure.</p>
<p>No wonder with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_mail_servers">feature packed those are nowadays</a>:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02-1024x566.png" alt="" class="wp-image-959" srcset="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02-1024x566.png 1024w,https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02-300x166.png 300w,https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02-768x425.png 768w,https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02-1536x849.png 1536w,https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02.png 1709w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>I admit, not all are pure mail servers and deliver much more value like a webmail interface. But this greatly visualizes the complexity such programs already have. Usually those tools can only do subsets of the tasks of SMTP, MTA or IMAP. </p>
<p>So for our use case of manually running our services we need to wire up Dovecot (as IMAP server), Postfix (as MTA/SMTP), sieve for server side filtering (which needs to interface with postifx) and amavis (for spam filtering) with a little bit of ClamAV (for virus scanning).</p>
<p>True, there are solutions out there that bundle all of this into single binaries. This might be convenient because configuration is easier but will usually come as closed source and with a price tag (per user).</p>
<p>Is your brain hurting yet? Cullum Smith has a <a href="https://www.c0ffee.net/blog/mail-server-guide/">great blog article on how to run to do such a setup</a>. Do I recommend it? <strong>NO!</strong> Hell no! Why? Well because if you got this far, you still haven’t checked all the other things so your mail actually gets delivered to other domains. Did I mention Backups yet?</p>
<h3>Your DNS setup probably sucks</h3>
<p>There is this joke I first heard when I started to look more into becoming a Site Reliability Engineer that when you are investigating an outage that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8cr1ve/it_is_always_dns/">“it is always DNS”</a>. In reality I’ve fallen into this trap several times, where I’ve looked at the server and running services. Everything seemed to work, but somehow the DNS got jammed up. Of course its the last thing I checked. (Got monitoring for your DNS? Of course you do!)</p>
<p>DNS is a simple text protocol (ha!, just like email) that is the heart of the internet. Sure we could use IP addresses to connect to systems, but those change frequently (because IPv6 is still not a thing) and nobody can be expected to remember a bunch of numbers.</p>
<p>The reason why DNS is hard, because we rely on it in such a fundamental way. It’s reliability is key to enable everything else to work. To increase the performance of DNS servers we have master/slave setups and anycast IPs. Are you planning on just setting up a DNS server on your one VM? Well, you are going to have a really bad time. </p>
<p>Latency is probably going to be high and there is no fallback with use one nameserver. You probably want to use multiple nameservers that are scattered throughout the world. No, your registrar (the site you “buy” the domain) is probably not going to give you such a setup. </p>
<p>Alright, then you use a hosted service from <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dns">Google Cloud DNS</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudns.net/">Cloudns</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/route53/">Route53</a>. Well good thinking, those vendors probably have the capacity to have a decent setup of servers throughout the world. But now you are trusting other entities with your DNS records and that they replicated them accurately throughout the world. Oh, you don’t trust them? You are using DNSSEC? Great!</p>
<p>How do you rotate the DNSSEC keys? Cause those also expire. Oh, and of course your registrar does not offer an API to change the DS records. Of course you have monitoring for this as well. </p>
<p>/rant – As you can probably tell, running your own DNS is already a superbly big challenge. Even if you get your server’s setup 100% correct, chances are you are going to fail at DNS at some point. Make sure to check out <a href="https://danrl.com/talks/slides-danrl-2017-gopher-meetup-human-friendly-dns.pdf">Dan’s presentation about other challenges in DNS land</a> and how he solved them at eGym. DNS today is superbly complex and if you can avoid it, please don’t ever run <em>“apt install bind9”</em>. </p>
<h3>SPF / DKIM</h3>
<p>Email in general is highly reliant on a few special DNS entries to establish trust between parties that don’t know each other. </p>
<p>The sender policy framework (SPF) is a simple DNS entry that controls which mail servers are allowed to send emails for a particular domain. In most cases you just want your MX server to be able to send emails, so you’d be good with:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="">v=spf1 mx ~all</code></pre>
<p>This will make anything that is not sent from a valid MX DNS entry usually be handled as spam on the receiving MTA. (But not all MTAs verify SPF records) Sounds simple right?</p>
<p>DKIM on the other hand adds signatures to every email that leaves your server. Your keys need to be also saved in a DNS record. I’ve used opendkim in the past, but the setup is also tedious and another extra step for each domain that I want to use. </p>
<p>Without SPF and DKIM you can probably forget to ever land in anyone’s inbox these days. Your email will in most cases be classified as spam and will not be read by many people. In some cases I’ve even seen other mail server just rejecting my mail because of a misconfiguration. (Which is absolutely the right thing to do – don’t get me wrong) </p>
<p>I haven’t even mentioned <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities">DANE</a> did I?</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The whole challenge in email is that its a distributed system where each part is controlled by different entities. You can setup your own domain / server in the best possible way and take all the precautions. (Trust me, you’ll fail more than once) </p>
<p><strong>Chances are high that your email will still land in spam folders.</strong></p>
<p>You will have to deal with the misconfiguration of other MTAs, Microsoft’s special handling of blacklisting and many other Email Blacklists out there (RBLs). </p>
<p>The standards are old and the software mostly cobbled together. Therefore you will have to implement a multitude of them to get decent delivery rates and not get swamped by spam. Of course don’t forget to add TLS to all your services, because we actually want transport to also be encrypted because nobody is using end to end encryption for mails.</p>
<p>I’ve been failing over the last ten years at getting my setup to a point where I’m completely happy with it. The time spent was significant (several weeks worth) and the results were at best mediocre. </p>
<p>So in order to no longer have to deal with this mess, I’ve finally bought <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/intl/de/">G Suite</a> and am migrating most of my users over.  Initial impressions are decent and it has most settings I’ve needed in the past years.</p>
<p>So long postfix, dovecot and ispconfig thanks for all the mails!</p>

<p>At age 10, I first got to know computers by a book from my brother called “C++ for game developers” even though I didn’t have the slightest idea of coding then and the book started out pretty steep with all kinds of things, over two-three years I managed to get through to the last page. </p>
<p>After I discovered PHP and web programming for me. It was totally contrary to what C++ had to offer: get things done, easily, quickly and without too much complexity. There I developed my first few complex web 2.0 applications.</p>
<p>Already then I realized that I’m somewhat not a loser at this whole programming thing. And let me it tell you: it was a lot of fun! So I decided quite early at the age of 14 to go to a technical high school, that would encourage me to dive deeper into computer science. At the HTL I also learned a lot about how a computers electronic circuits work and why things make sense the way they were designed. </p>
<p>Back then I already set my goals high to become a professional in this field. Especially my professors in Highschool encouraged me to shoot for the stars. Somebody told me back then, that a high school alumni a few years earlier became one of the best Google engineers. My goal where I wanted to get to was at that point set. I wanted to join Google as well.</p>
<p>Not that this was even close to realistic, but I tried to shoot high and see what was possible. So one of my professors encouraged me to apply to the Technical University of Munich instead of a regional college. I did just for fun and actually got in to my surprise.</p>

Learn more basics and tried to get through the courses nobody liked, but were mandatory. The network and possibilities how to work together in many of the groups around campus was just what I loved to do. I became project manager for the TUM campus app. I’m encouraging diversity at TUM through the diversity & queer division of the student Union. I organized a big truck on the Munich pride parade. I got to know a ton of amazing people and we have had amazing times together.</p>
<p>In December I finished my master thesis on site reliability engineering in transformative IT landscapes, looking at startups and mid sized companies that are planing to start applying SRE principles to their software projects. I’d like to thank <a href="https://danrl.com/">Dan Lüdtke</a> again, for mentoring my thesis and for chasing me to complete it in time.</p>

<p>Shoot for the stars. You might as well reach them and if not, stay persistent. It took me God knows how many applications until I got noticed. I tried again and again. Really wanting something is not enough. Trying ten times is not enough. If you think you are the best in that field, think again. Go to meetups to get to know other people. Be excellent every day. Be passionate about technology! Show the love <3 </p>
<p>Big shout out to anyone that supported me on this journey. My professors in high school and in university. My colleagues at my last jobs. All my friends that challenged me. (Chris and Philipp, I’m looking at you) Thanks to my family and my partner, who always believed in me and my goals. </p>

<p>Sometimes you need to provide a legacy access to various downloads or proxy some requests to a different endpoint, that might not be running in your cluster. One can natively redirect such requests with having to add additional deployments / containers to your Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>There is a special type of Kubernete’s service object that simply points any traffic to that external DNS name. This <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/5822">isn’t really document</a> all too well but eventually you will find enough issues and pointers to frankenstein a solution together. For anybody else looking on how to do this correctly, here is run down with nginx-ingress-controller:0.19.0 that worked for me.</p>
<p>First we create a normal ingress object, that allows us to terminate the SSL and look into the path of the HTTP request and decide if this is a request that is relevant to be proxied. </p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="yaml" class="language-yaml">apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: "<your-bucket-namespace>"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends: "true"
  name: artifacts
spec:
  rules:
    - host: downloads.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: "/artifacts/"
            backend:
              serviceName: proxy-artifacts
              servicePort: 443
  tls:
  - secretName: tls
    hosts:
    - downloads.example.com</code></pre>
<p>Lets quickly take a look at what is going on here. We first configure our Ingress Controller to use <em>nginx</em> and enable automatic provisioning via our cluster ACME/cert-manager.</p>
<p>Then we instruct nginx to rewrite the target URL to add the bucket. This way, we can swap buckets without the user facing URL having to change. (Notice to not include leading or trailing slashes)</p>
<p>Lastly we tell nginx, that the backend it should be expecting also is using TLS.</p>
<p>The rest of the ingress object is pretty standard. Define the hostname, the path and point it towards our service, that we will take a look at next.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="yaml" class="language-yaml">apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
spec:
  externalName: storage.googleapis.com
  type: ExternalName
metadata:
  name: proxy-artifacts</code></pre>
<p>The service object is pretty standard. Notice that we don’t have to specify the port explicitly with this special kind of service. The externalName property simply is the hostname of what external system you want to talk to.</p>
<p>Deploy those two configurations and you should be all set. Once you have all the quirks figured out, this is actually really simple and saves you from operating any additional reverse proxies in- or outside your cluster. </p>
